# Visualization API Clean Sandbox

This sample contains a minimal sandbox from which sandboxes for specific samples or experiments may be derived.
This sandbox is currently configured to use the `pentaho/visual/samples/calc` visualization â€” 
the only visualization that comes bundled with the Visualization API.

To quickly view the sandbox in operation, execute `npm install` in this folder and open `sandbox.html` through 
a local web-server (such as Python's, `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`).

For more information, see http://pentaho.github.io/pentaho-platform-plugin-common-ui/platform/visual/samples/bar-d3-sandbox/.
